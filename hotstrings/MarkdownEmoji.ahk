/*
Emoji helper

Some emoji names don't make much sense to me.
The hotstrings should be written as ":ok<space>", or ":!<space>" and they will be expanded.
":" is used to trigger the emoji as I want to reflect that this is an emoji.

Example:
Typing ":ok<space>"  will produce ":white_check_mark:<space>"
